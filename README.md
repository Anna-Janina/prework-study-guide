# Prework Study Guide Webpage


## Description

- This was my first coding project.
- First step of experiencing what web developers do every day.
- I stuck a few times and didn't know how to fix the problem. One time a tutor deleted everything and I just redid the whole project which was helpful to understand to process better. 
- I learned so much! But mainly out of my mistakes to double check if I created a new branch to my project.
